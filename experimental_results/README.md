# Experimental Results

This directory stores the plate-reader results from various characterization experiments detailed in the paper. Files labeled with 'ON' pertain to the OFF-to-ON characterization experiments, while those tagged 'OFF' relate to the ON-to-OFF experiments. Files marked with 'cropped' are versions of the original data wherein initial values have been cropped. This cropping is done to either:

a) Align the start of all experiments with the induction commencement.
b) Exclude data from the experimental setup phase.

**Files & Descriptions:**

- **`shai timer_20210811_123450_ON AraC 2 plasmids.xlsx`**: Characterization fluorescence data for the AraC gate upon inducer addition.

- **`shai timer_20210812_090202 OFF AraC 2 plasmidsd.xlsx`**: Fluorescence data for the AraC gate post inducer removal.

- **`Timer (Modified)_20210808_125346 ON LuxR 2 plasmids.xlsx`**: Characterization fluorescence data for the LuxR gate upon inducer addition.

- **`Timer (Modified)_20210809_090959 OFF LuxR 2 plasmids.xlsx`**: Fluorescence data for the LuxR gate post inducer removal.

- **`Timer (Modified)_20210808_125346 ON LuxR 2 plasmids - Cropped.xlsx`**: Fluorescence data for the LuxR gate after inducer addition, adjusted so fluorescence graphs originate from each distinct induction time.
