### Scripts

`UsingLMFIT-FIXED.py`

This is the script used for analyzing fits using LMFIT package and the ODE solver. 

`UsingLMFIT - OFF.py`

Same as before but to determine the value of $\tau_{OFF}$

`plotTauONys.py`

Used to make the bar graph used in the paper, to show the decrease of $\tau_{ON}^y$ for each induction time
