Ok so this script goes does parameter fitting without using any fixed parameter values, and for all the different conditions (t=0, t-180, etc.)
and exports an excel file with the fitted values

Things to change:
a) make the path a relative path (so that anyone can run this script from their computer.)
b) have options for luxR or AraC gate paramaterization
