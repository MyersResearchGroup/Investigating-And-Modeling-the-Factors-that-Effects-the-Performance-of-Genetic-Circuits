# Scripts
This directory is composed of two distinct subfolders, each dedicated to a different aspect of the paper's analysis. Both subfolders contain unique scripts that serve separate purposes.

## `free_parameters` Folder

This subdirectory holds the scripts used to deduce the model parameter values for the paper, without imposing any fixed parameter values, as detailed in the publication.


## `fixed_parameters` Folder

This section contains the scripts responsible for determining the paper's model parameter values. Here, all parameter values are held constant, with the exception of \( \Tau_{ON}^Y \), as detailed in the publication.
